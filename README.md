The 2022 Workshop on Probabilistic Approaches to Numerical Computation **(Prob Num 2022)** will take place in London on 28 and 29 March 2022.  The workshop has been generously supported by the [Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research](https://heilbronn.ac.uk) and is organised by [Chris Oates](https://oates.work) (Newcastle University and Alan Turing Institute, UK) and [Tim Sullivan](https://warwick.ac.uk/tjsullivan) (University of Warwick and Alan Turing Institute, UK).

[Probabilistic Numerics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_numerics) is a scientific field at the intersection of statistics, machine learning and applied mathematics, where tasks in numerical analysis including finding numerical solutions for integration, linear algebra, optimisation and differential equations are seen as problems of statistical, probabilistic, or Bayesian inference.  ProbNum 2022 continues a [sequence of research gatherings](https://www.probabilistic-numerics.org/meetings/) on probabilistic numerics over the last ten years.
